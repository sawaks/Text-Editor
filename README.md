# Text Editor (J.A.T.E)

## Description
This project is the proof that I learned throughÂ week 19. Build a text editor that runs in the browser with  IndexedDB. This application can use for offline. 

## Usage
1. Open the web application, type the some words which you want to memo. 
2. Press enter key or take out to forcus on the line and then the words will be saved automatically.
3. Press the `install` button. And then you can download as an application to your computer.

## Technology 
* IndexedDB: A data base
* CodeMirror: A code editor component for the web
* webpack: A module bundler for bundle JavaScript files
* workbox: A set of modules that simplify common service worker interactions such as routing and caching. Each module addresses a specific aspect of service worker development.
